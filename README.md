# Home-IOT-service
* Short Description<br/>
As the world are intersted in home IOT serive, we focused at the entrance.<br/>
We thought that it is hard to find the service for entrance, so we tried to suggest a IOT service for the entrance<br/><br/>

## Arduino IDE | Team project & Leader   August - December 2021 
Materials are written by Korean.<br/><br/>


## Main Function | Inspired by iPhone Siri, we implemented the service<br/>
- Mini virtual assistant <br/>
 Only ecognize the owner voice<br/>
 Owner can ask the today's weather and give orders such as open the door, check the parcel, turn the light.<br/>
- Turn the light if the sensor detect people <br/>
- Open the door if the sensor detect people at the entrace<br/>
**Limitaion : Slow voice recognition and output processing speed due to board-to-board connection**
